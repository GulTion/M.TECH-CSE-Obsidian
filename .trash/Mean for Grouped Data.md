To find the mean in grouped class range data, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Frequency Table**: List the class ranges and their corresponding frequencies.
2. **Find the Midpoints**: Calculate the midpoint for each class range.
3. **Multiply Midpoints by Frequencies**: Multiply each class midpoint by its frequency.
4. **Sum the Products**: Add all the products from step 3.
5. **Sum the Frequencies**: Add all

# Example

Sure, let's go through each step with an example. Suppose we have the following grouped class range data:

| Class Range | Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|
| 10 - 19     | 5         |
| 20 - 29     | 8         |
| 30 - 39     | 12        |
| 40 - 49     | 10        |
| 50 - 59     | 6         |

### Step 1: Create a Frequency Table

| Class Range | Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|
| 10 - 19     | 5         |
| 20 - 29     | 8         |
| 30 - 39     | 12        |
| 40 - 49     | 10        |
| 50 - 59     | 6         |

### Step 2: Find the Midpoints

To find the midpoints, we take the average of the lower and upper limits of each class range.

| Class Range | Midpoint | Frequency |
|-------------|----------|-----------|
| 10 - 19     | 14.5     | 5         |
| 20 - 29     | 24.5     | 8         |
| 30 - 39     | 34.5     | 12        |
| 40 - 49     | 44.5     | 10        |
| 50 - 59     | 54.5     | 6         |

### Step 3: Multiply Midpoints by Frequencies

| Class Range | Midpoint | Frequency | Midpoint × Frequency |
|-------------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| 10 - 19     | 14.5     | 5         | 72.5                 |
| 20 - 29     | 24.5     | 8         | 196                  |
| 30 - 39     | 34.5     | 12        | 414                  |
| 40 - 49     | 44.5     | 10        | 445                  |
| 50 - 59     | 54.5     | 6         | 327                  |

### Step 4: Sum the Products

Sum of (Midpoint × Frequency) = 72.5 + 196 + 414 + 445 + 327 = 1454.5

### Step 5: Sum the Frequencies

Sum of Frequencies = 5 + 8 + 12 + 10 + 6 = 41

### Step 6: Calculate the Mean

Mean = Sum of (Midpoint × Frequency) / Sum of Frequencies
     = 1454.5 / 41
     ≈ 35.4878

So, the mean of the grouped class range data is approximately 35.4878.

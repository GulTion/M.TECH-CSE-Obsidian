To find the mean for ungrouped data, follow these steps:

1. **List the Data**: Write down all the individual data points.
2. **Add up the Data**: Sum all the data points.
3. **Count the Data Points**: Determine the total number of data points.
4. **Apply the Mean Formula**: Divide the sum of the data points by the total number of data points.

Let's go through each step with an example:

### Step 1: List the Data

Suppose we have the following ungrouped data set:

\[5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20\]

### Step 2: Add up the Data

\[5 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 15 + 20 = 70\]

### Step 3: Count the Data Points

There are 6 data points in the set.

### Step 4: Apply the Mean Formula

Mean = \(\frac{70}{6} = 11.6667\)

So, the mean for the ungrouped data set is approximately \(11.6667\).

To find the median in grouped class range data, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Cumulative Frequency Table**: List the class ranges, their corresponding frequencies, and the cumulative frequencies.
2. **Identify the Median Class**: Find the class interval where the cumulative frequency just exceeds half of the total frequency.
3. **Apply the Median Formula**: Use the median formula to calculate the median within the identified median class.

Let's go through each step with an example using the same grouped class range data:

| Class Range | Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|
| 10 - 19     | 5         |
| 20 - 29     | 8         |
| 30 - 39     | 12        |
| 40 - 49     | 10        |
| 50 - 59     | 6         |

### Step 1: Create a Cumulative Frequency Table

| Class Range | Frequency | Cumulative Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------|
| 10 - 19     | 5         | 5                    |
| 20 - 29     | 8         | 13                   |
| 30 - 39     | 12        | 25                   |
| 40 - 49     | 10        | 35                   |
| 50 - 59     | 6         | 41                   |

### Step 2: Identify the Median Class

Total frequency = 41 (sum of all frequencies)

Half of the total frequency = 41 / 2 = 20.5

The median class is the class interval where the cumulative frequency just exceeds 20.5. In this case, it's the class interval 30 - 39.

### Step 3: Apply the Median Formula

Median = L + ((n/2 - F) / f) × w

Where:
- L = Lower limit of the median class (30)
- n = Total frequency (41)
- F = Cumulative frequency of the class before the median class (13)
- f = Frequency of the median class (12)
- w = Width of the median class interval (39 - 30 = 9)

Now, plug in the values:

Median = 30 + ((20.5 - 13) / 12) × 9
       = 30 + ((7.5 / 12) × 9)
       = 30 + (0.625 × 9)
       = 30 + 5.625
       ≈ 35.625

So, the median of the grouped class range data is approximately 35.625.

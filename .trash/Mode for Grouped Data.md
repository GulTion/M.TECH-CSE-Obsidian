To find the mode in grouped class range data, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Modal Class**: Determine the class interval with the highest frequency.
2. **Apply the Mode Formula**: Use the mode formula to calculate the mode within the identified modal class.

Let's use the same grouped class range data:

| Class Range | Frequency |
|-------------|-----------|
| 10 - 19     | 5         |
| 20 - 29     | 8         |
| 30 - 39     | 12        |
| 40 - 49     | 10        |
| 50 - 59     | 6         |

### Step 1: Identify the Modal Class

The modal class is the class interval with the highest frequency. In this case, it's the class interval 30 - 39 with a frequency of 12.

### Step 2: Apply the Mode Formula

Mode = L + ((f1 - f0) / (2 * f1 - f0 - f2)) × w

Where:
- L = Lower limit of the modal class (30)
- f1 = Frequency of the modal class (12)
- f0 = Frequency of the class before the modal class (8)
- f2 = Frequency of the class after the modal class (10)
- w = Width of the modal class interval (39 - 30 = 9)

Now, plug in the values:

Mode = 30 + ((12 - 8) / (2 * 12 - 8 - 10)) × 9
     = 30 + ((4) / (24 - 8 - 10)) × 9
     = 30 + ((4) / (6)) × 9
     = 30 + (0.6667) × 9
     = 30 + 6
     = 36

So, the mode of the grouped class range data is 36.
